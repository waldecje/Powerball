# Powerball

This program simulates the powerball game.  It was originally written by ChatGPT against a prompt for a simulation of the powerball multi-state lottery as a thought experiment.
At the time, the author had never coded in or even examined Python script.  The question was: could a person who had never used or even substatively seen Python be able to code in it?
The author's experience was in Perl and shell scripting and 20 years in disuse.

ChatGPT mad a very basic, single draw simulation.

Subsequently, the following features were added by the author as I "learned" Python
- Drawing continuously for a prompted amount of time
- Drawing continuously until a jackpot is won
- Tracking of Prize winnings and presentation of statistics and totals
- Validation of input (ensuring entry does not contain invalid/impossible numbers.)
- Future plans for random "quick pick" selection of numbers combined with the option for multiple simultaneous QP's per drawing (simulatiung how a consumer would play the 3x weekly game using QP)

The program is now being used as a base for learning git, Jenkins, and other more modern developer/devops tools, along with improving Python skills.
